# Snow OS

**Snow OS** is a **browser-based operating system** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates a modern desktop environment right in your browser, allowing you to experience a full OS interface without installing anything.

## Features

* **Desktop Environment**: draggable and resizable windows, desktop icons, taskbar, and start menu.
* **Files App**: browse and open local text and audio files directly inside Snow OS.
* **Music App**: play local audio files in a dedicated window.
* **Notes App**: create, edit, and save notes per user.
* **Terminal**: execute basic commands like `help`, `about`, `echo [msg]`, and `clear`.
* **Browser App**: load websites that allow embedding inside an iframe.
* **Settings**: choose from default wallpapers to customize your desktop.
* **Persistent Storage**: user data is saved using `localStorage` for each account.

## Demo

A **live demo** is available â€” try Snow OS in your browser to explore the desktop experience. Development on the main version is ongoing with more features planned.
